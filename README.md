# Project README

## Introduction
This project is a simple document management application built using React.js. It utilizes various components to create an efficient and user-friendly interface for managing documents.

## Features
- **Document Cards**: Each document is represented as a card containing its description, file size, and optional actions.
- **Dynamic Tagging**: Documents can be tagged with different labels for easy identification.
- **Smooth Animations**: Framer Motion is used to create fluid drag-and-drop animations for enhanced user experience.

## Technologies Used
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Framer Motion**: A library for creating fluid animations and interactions in React applications.

## How React.js Makes Our Work Efficient
React.js provides a component-based architecture, allowing developers to break down the UI into reusable and self-contained components. This modular approach streamlines development, enhances code organization, and promotes code reusability. Additionally, React.js efficiently handles virtual DOM updates, resulting in better performance and faster rendering times.

## How Framer Motion Enhances User Experience
Framer Motion adds powerful animation capabilities to React applications, enabling developers to create engaging and interactive user interfaces. By leveraging features like drag-and-drop animations, smooth transitions, and gesture controls, Framer Motion enhances the overall user experience of the application. These animations not only make the application visually appealing but also improve usability and intuitiveness.

## Project Structure
- **App.js**: The main component that renders the application.
- **Background.js**: Component responsible for rendering the background elements.
- **Foreground.js**: Component containing the main content of the application.
- **Card.js**: Component representing individual document cards.
